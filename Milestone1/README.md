For this milestone, we had to create a model capable to predict the collapse capacity of a building given a set of values caracterising an earthquake.

We developped two main models, one based on neural networks and the other based on a decision tree. We got the best result with the tree.

## Our Code :

Our code can be found in two different notebooks :
- tree.ipynb presents our code for our decision tree.
- Neural Networks.ipynb presents our code for our neural networks.
